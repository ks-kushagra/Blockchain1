1. You will need a command line application. For MacOS and Linux,
I recommend the native Terminal application. Iterm2 is also a good option on MacOS. 
For Windows, I recommend using the Git Bash shell application.

2. You will need a code editor.
Use whatever you're already comfortable with. But if you're looking for one, 
I recommend Visual Studio Code (it's the code editor used in the course).
I also suggest configuring the editor to be launchable from the command line.
Do so by pressing 

"CMD-Shift-P"
, and typing in "Shell." An option for

"Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" 

should appear. Select it, and re-start your command line and Visual Studio Code.



We will use NodeJS as the engine to run our JavaScript-based project. Make sure you have Node installed on your system.
Here is the installation link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. You’ll need to download the appropriate installer 
for your system, and go through the installation process.

With Node installed, you should get responses similar to this on the command line:

$ node -v

v8.8.1 (or something similar)

$ npm -v

5.4.2 (or something similar)

We’ll also use a tool called Postman. 
This app will allow us to send custom HTTP Requests to our running blockchain servers. 
Here is the link to install Postman:
