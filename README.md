Blockchain

Blockchain The blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that stores data such as transactions and that is publicly shared across all the nodes of its network. 
 
The ledger consists of multiple blocks of data chain together like a link in physical chain. 
 
 
So , how  these links created? Well,every block has given a unique value that looks like a random string of characters known an Hash Value which is generated from a hash function.So it creates unique output for a unique input. 
 
Block 
Blocks are files where data pertaining to the​ ​bitcoin network are permanently recorded. A block records some or all of the most recent Bitcoin transactions that have not yet entered any prior blocks. Thus, a block is like a page of a ledger or record book. Each time a block is ‘completed’, it gives way to the next block in the​ ​blockchain. A block is thus a permanent store of records which, once written, cannot be altered or removed. 
 
 
Digital Ledger
A distributed ledger is decentralized to eliminate the need for a central authority or intermediary to process, validate or authenticate transactions. Enterprises use distributed ledger technology to process, validate or authenticate transactions or other types of data exchanges. Typically, these records are only ever stored in the ledger when the consensus has been reached by the parties involved. All files in the distributed ledger are then timestamped and given a unique cryptographic signature. All of the participants on the distributed ledger can view all of the records in question. The technology provides a verifiable and auditable history of all information stored on that particular dataset. 
 
 
 
 
The Benefits Of Blockchain And Distributed Ledger Technology 

A distributed ledger gives control of all its information and transactions to the users and promotes transparency. They can minimise transaction time to minutes and are processed 24/7 saving businesses billions. The technology also facilitates increased back-office efficiency and automation. 
Distributed ledgers such as blockchain are exceedingly useful for financial transactions. They cut down on operational inefficiencies (which ultimately saves money). Greater security is also provided due to their decentralized nature, as well as the fact that the ledgers are immutable. 
Alternatively, blockchain technology offers a way to securely and efficiently create a tamper-proof log of sensitive activity. This includes anything from international money transfers to shareholder records. Financial processes are radically upgraded to offer companies a secure, digital alternative to processes run by a clearinghouse. Altogether avoiding these often bureaucratic, time-consuming, paper-heavy, and expensive processes
